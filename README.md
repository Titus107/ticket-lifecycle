The first thing we will want to do is to login to osTicket from the end-user point at localhost/osTicket. Now from this portal we can select "open a new ticket" and enter our login information. Fill out the information fields for the help topic, issue summary, and ticket details then create the ticket. For the sake of example, create a few more tickets and create various issues.

If we go back to the ticketing system from the perspective of an agent we can login with our credentials and see the various tickets created just earlier. We can either use our main account or give admin privileges to another user by navigating to ->Admin Panel ->Agents, select your agent and go to "permissions" and edit them. Alternatively, navigate to "access" and assign them a custom role with pre-established privileges.

</p>
<p>
Go to the Agent Panel at the top right of the screen and we can see the tickets we created. From here, click on one. We can edit the severity, assign a ticket to someone, make comments, and resolve the ticket. We can change the severity by clicking on the text next to "priority".
  </p>
Assign an agent to a ticket by selecting the  "assign" button with an image of a person on it in the top right corner pictured above. This will prompt you to select an agent for the ticket. Finally, if the issue has been resolved then you can also navigate to the same top-right corner and click on the icon with the flag. This will prompt you to resolve the ticket if applicable and make comments.
